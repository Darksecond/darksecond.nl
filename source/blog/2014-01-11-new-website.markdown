Finally after a long time, I finally decided it was time to build my own website and blog.
It is primarily a blog for to put hacks, research and ideas on.

The design is based on the work by [Carlos Becker](http://carlosbecker.com), [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com) and [Niels Rasmussen](http://nielsrasmus.github.io).
It is hosted by Github using [Github Pages](http://github.io).

I decided Github Pages was ideal, since I really just need static html.
Github Pages also provides support for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
This means I can write blog posts in markdown and have generic layouts that get applied to all pages.

It took me a few days to work out all the bugs in my design and get to the point I am happy with it.
The source for the website can be found at [Github](http://github.com/Darksecond/Darksecond.github.io).
I'm sure there are quite a few bugs to work out. If you happen to find any, let me know!
